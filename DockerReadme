Dockerisation
--------
Dockerisation should now work.  Build or Pull, then run with something similar to:

docker run -it -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix incinders/birp-bigironreconandpwnage  <BIRP options>

eg
```
â†’ docker run -it -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix incinders/birp -h
usage: birp.py [-h] [-t TARGET] [-s SLEEP] [-l LOADFILE] [-q]

Big Iron Recon & Pwnage (BIRP) by @singe

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TARGET, --target TARGET
                        Target IP address or hostname & port: TARGET[:PORT].
                        The default port is 23. If you don't specify a target,
                        you can manually specify it in the emulator
  -s SLEEP, --sleep SLEEP
                        Seconds to sleep between actions (increase on slower
                        systems). The default is 0 seconds.
  -l LOADFILE, --load LOADFILE
                        Load a previously saved history file
  -q, --quiet           Ssssh! Don't print info text.

It's easier than you think

xhost local:root - may help if you have X issues: https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles/issues/6

Theres a dockerisation-ssl - GitHub / docker -  tag, which is a work in progress. Ideally building in direct SSL support.  Not currently working, I think due to lack of libraries.  The docker latest tag uses alpine python for a smaller image.
